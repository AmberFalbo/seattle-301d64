# Node, npm, and Express

## Overview

Today we will take a step into the back end, beginning to write a proper `server.js` file to serve API data to the City Explorer client application. You will continue to build out this file through lab 9, working with a new partner each day.

Another component of this portion of the course involves working with a static client which you have no control over. You will be able to view the source code for this client, but will not be permitted to modify it in anyway. Servers and clients are separate entities; the only relationships that exist between them are the relationships we create. This week, you will be creating those relationships.

## Daily Plan

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 6 of Code 301, students will:
- Begin to understand how the world wide web works
- Be able to explain the role of the browser and the server as components of the web request-response cycle
- Understand how to initialize a NodeJS project and use NPM packages
- Understand the basics of working with ExpressJS 
- Control their production and deployment environments
- Understand how to interact with a static client code base

## Feedback

### The most helpful

- Instructional staff & TAs
   A shoutout to Skyler for being such an awesome TA and Lena for her amazing teaching methods and always being patient!  Always makes me feel happy when we receive love.
- Pair programming
   Often this is in the mixed zone, but with this class, it's positive!  Learning how to communicate and work with others is a huge life skill!

### The mixed

- Code review - Why can't we review all of the things?
   The blunt version of this answer is time.  If we spend too much time in code review, then we have to find this time else where to ensure we've properly covered the lecture.  If there are things that you don't feel comfortable with, just ask us!
- Code challenges - Useful or not?
   While the code challenges seem silly, there will be a time where you'll think back about this later and be like "Oh!  I did something like this!" and you'll be glad because you'll have the resources and knowledge.

### The least helpful

- Readings - Why???
   When it comes to these, the amount of information that you end up absorbing is insane.  While you may not think it, give it a few days to soak in and you'll be happy that you spent that time reading up on things.
- Pace - Why's it so fast?
   Every student asks this question.  It is by design, but as long as you don't give up, you will succeed.  And don't worry, after a certain point it just feels like the normal pace.
